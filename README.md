#  Car Price Analysis – Novanectar Internship

This repository contains a complete data analytics project submitted as part of my internship with **Novanectar Pvt Ltd**. The objective of the project is to analyze various features of cars to understand the key factors that influence their **market price**.

---

##  Objective

To explore, clean, and analyze the dataset using Python and generate insights using:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations (heatmap, pairplot, histogram, bar chart)
- Business insights and recommendations

##  Files in This Repository

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CarPriceAnalysis.ipynb` | Full Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, EDA, and visual insights |
| `Cleaned_CarPrice_Assignment.csv` | Cleaned dataset after preprocessing |
| `README.md` | This readme file |
| `Final_Report.pdf` | Summary of key insights and outcomes (also included in notebook) |

##  Key Insights

- Engine size is the strongest predictor of price.
- City mileage (MPG) is negatively correlated with price.
- Luxury brands like **BMW, Jaguar, and Porsche** have higher average prices.
- The dataset was clean with no missing values, saving preprocessing time.
- Highly correlated features were removed to prevent model redundancy.

##  Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
